# DirMaker
Use case:
 +25 min improve on creation! More directories to create, more time saved!
  Starting with a simple .txt with 30 names and two subdirectories within, we wasted 20 minutes.
  With DirMaker you can do it in 30 seconds.

Project that manages to create directores in a quicker and easy way. 

In college courses we usually make directories that has some structure inside and normally it's slow and painful doing it on Windows. This project has saved my time and many collegue's time when we create directories. 
This project saves time and it's easy to use.
